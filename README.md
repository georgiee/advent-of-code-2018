# Advent of Code 2018
Learning Rust with AoC 2018. Worked on this during the year of 2019 and stopped around day 05 already. 

Rust is difficult. In AoC you need to be experimental and quickly check some stuff, debug, output and so on. Especially Debugging and Mutations are not your friends with Rust. It's actually an awesome feature in Rust that  Mutations are more difficult. But this involves reference borrowing which is mind twisting from time to time.

The error messages were great and helpful but this didn't help to keep the motivation up.
